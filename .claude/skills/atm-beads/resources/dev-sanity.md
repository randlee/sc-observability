# Dev Sanity Check

The assignment for a sanity check bead. When and how it runs is in
[`orchestrating.md`](orchestrating.md) ("Dev Sanity Check").

## Recipient

The member that fills the `dev-sanity` role (not a dev or fix agent, which
would make sanity checks wait behind their work). The repository maps the
role to a team-unique member in `roles:` of `.claude/agents/registry.yaml`
(`obs-sanity` here), and the member's `[startup.<member>]` prompt in
`.atm.toml` names the directive it runs (`.claude/agents/dev-sanity-llm.md`
here). The role contract is
[`../../atm-bd-orchestration/roles/dev-sanity.md`](../../atm-bd-orchestration/roles/dev-sanity.md).

The sanity check bead's `assignee` is that member:
`.claude/skills/atm-beads/scripts/resolve-role dev-sanity`. `validate-plan`
rejects any other assignee, and a member that is not in `atm members`. If
the team has no such member, lead adds one before the plan is imported (the
`team-lead` skill, Step 3).

Here the member runs terra and its background checks run luna. Candidates to replace it later:
Haiku 5.5 once released (Haiku 4.5 is too weak for this), and typesafe.ai
(<https://typesafe.ai/>), to be evaluated; a new check is a new directive
and subagent, chosen in `.atm.toml`.

## Message

The dev-sanity member sends the check this message with the dev bead in
its fenced JSON payload (`.claude/agents/sc-sanity-llm.md` "Inputs"). The sanity check bead's description
carries the same message, so the instruction can be taken from it:
`bd show <dev-sanity-bead> --json | jq -r '.[0].description'`.


Verify that the work is done:

- the agent did not skip anything;
- there are no obvious errors;
- lint passes.

This is not QA.
